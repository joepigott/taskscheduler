# Task Scheduler

Upon finishing a college course in operating systems, I realized that I am
terrible at scheduling tasks in an efficient way. So, I decided to create a
scheduler to algorithmically select the order in which I should work on tasks.
Hopefully this takes away some mental overhead, and allows one to focus on the
actual task rather than stress about getting multiple things done.

## Development

Currently prototyping. This README will be updated with more information once
the product is functional.
